	<p style="width:800px"> Student skate night was a blast! Us tired students, in the midst of midterms, took a break from
studying to spend some quality time together and make unforgettable college memories. I am a former hockey player, so skating 
with friends was an enjoyable experience. Now that the fun is over, it's time to hit the books and prepare for the next round of midterms.

	<p style="width:800px"> Every year, UW-Madison gives us a 1 month long break between fall and spring semester. This year I took this time off as an
	opportunity to visit my siblings, who live in Colorado, and get a breath of fresh air. We skied Vail and Keystone and enjoyed each others 
	company alongside the beautiful scenery. It was a nice break from class and allowed to me to connect back with nature and rediscover by 
	passion for the outdoors.
