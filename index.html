	<h1> What is this all about? </h1>
	<p style="width:800px"> I am here to educate and inform you on the unique projects/events happening in civil engineering
	and to give you insite through my blog as to what it is like to be a college engineering student. <br>
	Please follow along and you will become more informed on the world of civil engineering. </p>
	<h1> A little about me: </h1>
	<p style="width: 800px"> I am currently a senior at UW-Madison studying Civil Engineering and expecting to graduate in December of 2022.
	I am originally from Lakeville, Minnesota where I graduated high school in 2018. All my life, I have been an avid lover of the outdoors 
	and wanting to better the world. I believe with a future job in this profession, I will be able to do that. Over the course of the past 
	few years, I have had different internships that have helped me accomplish some "out of class" learning and gain a lot of knowledge into
	this line of work. From October 2019 - June 2020, I worked for the universityâ€™s Traffic Operations and Safety Laboratory (TOPS) and learned
	more about the traffic engineering side of civil. After that, I did a co-op job with Findorff from June 2020 - January 2021 and worked part-time
	through the spring semester where I learned more about construction project management with buildings. After that I worked for Ruekert-Mielke 
	from June 2021 - August 2021 where I learned about land development and civil design. This is where I found a passion because I felt like 
	I could apply my engineering knowledge with designing, but also use my project management skills. This led me to now have an internship for 
	Kimley Horn in Saint Paul this summer where I will be doing design and project management work.
